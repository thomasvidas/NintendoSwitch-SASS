# Nintendo Switch - SASS

[Look at this!](http://thomasvidas.github.com/NintendoSwitch-SASS)

The Nintendo Switch was just shown today for the first time!  If you have a Nintendo
themed website or blog that you would like to add this to your website, please give
credit to me (Thomas Vidas) and link back to my Github profile somewhere on your website.
Even if its just a tiny piece on your website on an about.html or thanks.html, I'd appreciate
it.

### Usage

To use this file you must have [SASS installed](http://sass-lang.com/install).
To create the CSS file run the following command.

```
sass switch.scss style.css
```

This will create the stylesheet that you can add to your existing css file.

You can set the size of the icon by changing `size` in switch.scss to whatever size you want.
I modeled it off of the *192px x 192px icon*, but it looks fine at *512px x 512px* and
*64px x 64px*.
