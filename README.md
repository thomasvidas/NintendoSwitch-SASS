# Nintendo Switch - SASS

[Look at this!](http://thomasvidas.github.com/NintendoSwitch-SASS)

### Usage

To use this file you must have [SASS installed](http://sass-lang.com/install).
To create the CSS file run the following command.

```
sass switch.scss style.css
```

This will create the stylesheet that you can add to your existing css file.

You can set the size of the icon by changing `size` in switch.scss to whatever size you want.
I modeled it off of the *192px x 192px icon*, but it looks fine at *512px x 512px* and
*64px x 64px*.
